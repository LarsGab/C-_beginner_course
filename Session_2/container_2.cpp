/*
EXERCISE: Unique Element Counter using std::set

Create a program that reads a sequence of integers 
from the user and counts the number of unique elements 
in the sequence using std::set. The program prompts the 
user to enter integers one by one until they decide to 
stop by entering a non-integer value. Afterward, it should 
display the count of unique elements in the sequence.

Hints:
1. Declare a std::set<int> to store the unique elements.
2. Use a loop to repeatedly prompt the user to enter an integer and insert it into the set.
3. Break the loop when the user enters a non-integer value (e.g., a character or string).
4. After reading the sequence, the size of the set will represent the count of unique elements.
