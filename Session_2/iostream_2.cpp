/*
Exercise: Word Counter

Write a C++ program that reads a text file and 
counts the number of words in it. 
The program should open the file 'file.txt' in Session_2, 
read its contents, and count the number of words in it. 
A word is considered any sequence of non-space characters 
separated by spaces, tabs, or newline characters.

Hints:

1. Open the file using std::ifstream and 
    check if the file was opened successfully.
2. Create a counter variable to keep track of the number of words.
3. Use a loop to read the contents of the 
   file character by character and count the words.
4. Consider any whitespace characters (space, tab, newline) as word separators.
5. Display the final word count to the user using std::cout.

int main() {
    std::string filename {"file.txt"};
    
    // Define the word counter below...
    
    return 0;
