/*
EXERCISE: Simple Calculator

Write a C++ program that acts as a simple calculator. 
The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers 
and an arithmetic operation ('+' or '-'). 
Based on the chosen operation, the program should perform 
the corresponding arithmetic calculation and display the result.

Hints:

Prompt the user to enter the first number, second number, and the arithmetic operation.
Use std::cin to read the input from the user and store the values in appropriate variables.
Use if-else statements to determine the chosen operation and perform the corresponding calculation.
Display the result of the calculation using std::cout.

    // Define the calculator below...
