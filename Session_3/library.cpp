Exercise: Simple Library Management System

Create a simple library management system using C++. 
The program should allow users to add books, display all books, 
and search for books in the library.

Task:

- Create a class called Book to represent a book with the following attributes: 
    title, author, and ISBN number.
Implement member functions for the Book class to set and get these attributes.
- Create a class called Library that manages a collection of books.
- Implement member functions for the Library class to add a book to 
  the collection, display all books in the collection, and search for a book by title or author.
- In the main function, provide a simple menu system to allow users to interact with the library:
    1. "Add a book" option: Prompt the user to enter the title, author, 
        and ISBN number of the book, and add it to the library.
    2. "Display all books" option: Display the details of all the books in the library.
    3. "Search for a book" option: Prompt the user to enter a search 
        term (title or author), and display the details of any books that match the search term.
    4. "Exit" option: Terminate the program.
- The program should handle invalid user inputs gracefully and provide 
  appropriate error messages if needed.*/
