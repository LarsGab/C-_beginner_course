two players to play against each other.

Task:

- Implement a function to display the Tic-Tac-Toe board on the screen.
- Create a function to get input from the players for their moves (row and column).

- In the main function, initialize the Tic-Tac-Toe board and display it to the players.
- Prompt each player to enter their move alternatively until one of them wins 
    or the game ends in a draw.
- After each move, display the updated board and check for a win or draw condition.
- Display the result (win, draw, or continue) after each move.
